    Fix PostgreSQL guest agent issues for password changes and access control.

    - Fix AttributeError when changing user passwords due to improper
      deserialization in PgSqlAdmin.change_passwords method.
    - Update grant_access and revoke_access methods to handle PostgreSQL
      changes:

      * Explicitly grant/revoke schema (public) access for PostgreSQL 14+
      * Revoke CONNECT privilege from PUBLIC to ensure proper revocation
      * Ensure connection is made to specific database for grant/revoke
        operations in PostgreSQL 16+
