$ tox

$ tox -epy27

To generate a coverage report,run:
$ tox -ecover
(note: on some boxes, the results may not be accurate unless you run it twice)

If you'd like to start up a fake Trove API daemon for integration testing
with your own tool, run:
$ ./bin/start_server

Stop the server with:
$ ./bin/stop_server
